Guesthouse vision: Daisuke Kajiyama and his late wife Hila convinced the owners of an abandoned Japanese house to let them turn it into a guesthouse. 'Akiya' house: While they were aware that they had a lot of work ahead of them, the couple were thrilled to be one step closer to having their own guesthouse. Renovation process: Kajiyama took on much of the work on the guesthouse himself, replacing the floors and adding in a toilet, which he says was a wedding present from his parents. Lengthy project: "From my several years of backpacking I saw so many interesting buildings," says Kajiyama, who had little renovation experience before taking the project on. "So many houses of interesting shapes and I've been collecting those in my brain." Complete makeover: Around two years after beginning work on the house, which has been named Yui Valley, they were able to welcome their first guests. Dream realized: "It was a beautiful feeling," says Kajiyama. "Of course, this was my dream. But people really appreciate that it [the house] was abandoned and I brought it back to life." Country retreat: Yui Valley has helped to bring many travelers to the village of Tamatori over the years. Team effort: Kajiyama stresses that he wouldn't have been able to make Yui Valley what it is today with Hila, who passed away in 2022. "We were really together," he says. "She created this place with me. Without her it would not have been like this."
