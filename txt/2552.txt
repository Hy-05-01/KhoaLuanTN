Climate scientist Michael Mann sued the conservative magazine in 2012 after two columnists wrote about his work and the "Hockey Stick" curve graph illustrating the rise in average global temperatures, accusing him of "misconduct" and data "manipulation." Alito writes that the case brings up First Amendment concerns "that go to the very heart of the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and freedom of the press: the protection afforded to journalists and others who use harsh language in criticizing opposing advocacy on one of the most important public issues of the day. If the Court is serious about protecting freedom of expression, we should grant review." June 24, 2022 - The Supreme Court overturns Roe v.
