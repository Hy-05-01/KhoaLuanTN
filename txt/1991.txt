Kelly Clarkson has a story to tell and, naturally, she's telling it through her music. The "American Idol" alum posted a video to her verified social media accounts on Sunday revealing that "Chemistry" is the title of her upcoming album, and that listeners can expect to hear both the new album and new music from it "really soon." Clarkson said that she was "trying to find a word that really described the whole thing" instead of her listeners thinking the album was related to just one or two emotions of "I'm sad" or "I'm angry." "Chemistry can be a really amazing, sexy, cool, fun thing but it can also be very bad for you," she said. The "Kelly Clarkson Show" host told Variety in 2022 that this album has been therapeutic in healing from her divorce from ex-husband Brandon Blackstock. "The whole divorce thing happened, and I needed to write it," she said. "And then I didn't know if I was going to release it, because you can be very angry in that state of mind. So some of the songs, they definitely cover the gamut of emotions; there's everything on the album." Clarkson filed for divorce from Blackstock in 2020 citing "irreconcilable differences," according to court documents obtained by CNN at the time. The divorce was settled in March of 2022. The former couple share two children. In her post on Sunday, Clarkson said that the album covers all aspects of a certain relationship -- without naming Blackstock specifically. "This album is definitely the arc of an entire relationship, and a whole relationship shouldn't be just brought down to one thing," she said, adding that "there's the good, the bad and the ugly kind of thing going on in it." Clarkson last released a Christmas album in 2021, after releasing the pop-rock album titled "Meaning of Life" in 2017.
