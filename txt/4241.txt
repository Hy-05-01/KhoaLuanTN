Here's some background information about the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal which took place during the Iraq war. Facts Abu Ghraib prison was a US Army detention center for captured Iraqis from 2003 to 2006. An investigation into the treatment of detainees at the prison was prompted by the discovery of graphic photos depicting guards abusing detainees in 2003. The facility was located 20 miles west of Baghdad on 280 acres. At the height of the scandal, the prison held as many as 3,800 detainees. Most of the detainees lived in tents in the prison yards. The abuses took place inside the prison in cell blocks 1A and 1B. Eleven US soldiers were convicted of crimes relating to the Abu Ghraib scandal. Seven of those were from Maryland-based 372nd Military Police Company. A number of other service members were not charged but reprimanded.
