Former President Donald Trump landed in his hometown of New York City where he is expected to voluntarily surrender after being indicted last week. He left his gated Florida Resort Mar-a-Lago Monday to board his private jet, which has served as an iconic backdrop for his campaign events since 2016. Trump's beloved gold-plated Boeing 757 with Rolls-Royce engines carried him from Palm Beach International Airport around 1 p.m. ET and landed at New York's LaGuardia airport around 3:30 p.m. ET. Secret Service limos will receive the former president and drive him to Trump Tower to spend the night before going to Manhattan's criminal court building tomorrow where he is expected to turn himself in. We're tracked Trump's plane from take-off to landing via ADS-B Exchange, a network of antennas tracking publicly-available aircraft transponder signals. See the path the plane took on the map below.
