A Manhattan court sentenced Abdullah el-Faisal to 18 years in prison after a nearly three-month trial in which he was found guilty of five terrorism-related charges. He is the first person to be tried under New York state terror laws passed after the September 11, 2001, attacks, the New York's district attorney's office said. Brynn Gingras reports.
