Emotional purchase: A group of Italians with links to the forsaken village of San Severino di Centola in Campania have come together to buy the village's medieval district. Ghost village: San Severino di Centola was left pretty much abandoned when the last residents left in the 1970s. Rescue mission: Around 15 years ago, Silverio D'Angelo joined forces with eight others, who live across Italy, to purchase the abandoned homes in the ghost hamlet. Strong attachment: "We were driven by a visceral love for this place, by passion for our roots and ancestors," D'Angelo tells CNN Travel. Determined pursuit: Concerned that the ghost village would fall prey to unscrupulous investors, D'Angelo and the others knocked on the doors of the heirs of past owners to persuade them to sell. Scenic village: Located south of Naples in the pristine Cilento National Park, San Severino di Centola is surrounded by pristine ragged hills, forests and streams. Slow process: The group hasn't been able to get much work done so far, mainly due to a lack of resources and bureaucracy issues, since it made the purchase in 2008. Daytripper's heaven: Open year-round, the hamlet attracts around 50,000 visitors a year and is bustling during summer months. Revitalizing process: The only sections of San Severino di Centola that have been restyled, with public funds, are the castle, the path leading up to it, and the village piazza. Long abandoned: San Severino di Centola is one of around 6,000 abandoned ghost hamlets or villages around Italy that have been deserted due to either migration or natural disasters. Protecting the past: "Saving places like this from abandonment is a duty of all of us," says PR consultant Monica Gillocchi, one of the village "rescuers." "Because these old villages are the backbone of our wonderful country."
