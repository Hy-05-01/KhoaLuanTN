A Delaware man might have visited Florida just for the sun, but he came home $5 million richer. Peter Sullivan, 66, took home the jaw-dropping prize after purchasing a $20 scratch-off ticket from a Publix grocery store in Delray Beach, according to a news release from the Florida Lottery. Sullivan, a resident of Millsboro, Delaware, chose to receive his winnings in a one-time lump sum payment of $3,960,000, the release noted. The Publix grocery store where Sullivan bought his lucky ticket will also receive a $2,000 bonus. The newly-made millionaire beat astonishing odds to take home his prize. The chances of winning the $5 million prize in the "Gold Rush" game are just 1 in 2,362,500, according to the Florida Lottery's website.
