Here is some background information about the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. Facts The blast killed 168 people, including 19 children, and injured several hundred more. Timothy J. McVeigh and Terry L. Nichols were convicted of the attack. The federal building was later razed and a park and memorial were built on the site. The Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum has 168 stone and glass chairs placed in rows on a lawn, one for each victim. Both McVeigh and Nichols were former US Army soldiers and were associated with the extreme right-wing and militant Patriot movement. The Patriot movement rejects the legitimacy of the federal government and law enforcement. April 19 marked two anniversaries. Patriots' Day is the anniversary of the American rebellion against British authority at Lexington, Massachusetts, in 1775. It is also the date that federal agents raided the compound of a religious sect in Waco, Texas, after a 51-day standoff in 1993. At least 75 members of the Branch Davidian sect died in a fire that began during the raid. McVeigh claimed he targeted the building in Oklahoma City to avenge the raid on Waco.
