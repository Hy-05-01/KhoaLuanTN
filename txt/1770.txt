Actor Jonathan Majors was arraigned on several assault and harassment charges Sunday, the Manhattan DA's office tells CNN. The complaint does not name the female accuser but claims the defendant did "strike her about the face with an open hand, causing substantial pain and a laceration behind her ear." She also claims the defendant "put his hand on her neck, causing bruising and substantial pain." CNN has reached out to representatives for Majors for comment on his arraignment. A judge released Majors on his own recognizance and granted a limited order of protection, according to the DA's office. Majors' attorney told CNN Sunday there are "two written statements from the woman recanting these allegations," adding that they are presenting evidence to the DA including "video footage from the vehicle where this episode took place, witness testimony from the driver and others who both saw and heard the episode," Attorney Priya Chaudhry expects the charges to be dropped. The Manhattan DA's office would not comment regarding the defense attorney's claims the woman recanted. The NYPD deferred to the DA's office. Majors, who recently starred in "Creed III" and "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania," was arrested Saturday morning in an alleged domestic dispute, New York police told CNN over the weekend. Majors, 33, was taken into custody following a 911 call made from an apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, according to a statement from the New York Police Department. Chaudhry told CNN it was Majors who called 911 due to concerns for the woman's mental health. In addition to his recent high-profile roles, Majors, who was nominated for an Emmy for his role in HBO's "Lovecraft Country," is poised to be a major part of the next phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
