Catherine Shoichet is a senior writer covering immigration and demographics for CNN Digital. Her in-depth reporting has earned awards from the Society for Features Journalism and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. In 2017, she was a finalist for a Livingston Award for excellence in national reporting. She wrote a four-part series uncovering hidden stories inside the Southeast's largest immigrant detention center, flew to Guatemala on an ICE deportation flight, followed a family divided by the Trump administration's travel ban and chronicled how fear ripples through communities on both sides of the debate. Shoichet joined CNN in 2010 and has played a key role in covering national and international news for the network. She's fluent in Spanish and has worked closely with CNN en Espa√±ol to cover breaking news in Latin America, including Mexico's drug war, political upheaval in Venezuela and Iran's efforts to build influence in the region. Before she came to CNN, Shoichet began her professional journalism career at the St. Petersburg Times in Florida, where she wrote about five tropical storms, two alligator attacks, one international real estate scam and countless county commission meetings. She shifted her focus toward global news in 2008, when Columbia University's journalism school awarded her the Gray Fellowship for International Reporting. She graduated with an M.A. in political journalism and moved to Mexico, where she worked in the Mexico City bureau of The Associated Press. Before that, Shoichet attended Harvard College, where she studied history and literature and covered the university's administration for The Harvard Crimson. Her work also has appeared in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and The Chronicle of Higher Education.
