Here's a look at the Iditarod dogsled race. The event is named after the Iditarod Trail, an old mail and supply route, traveled by dogsleds from Seward and Knik to Nome, Alaska. March 14, 2023 - Ryan Redington wins his first Iditarod. March 15, 2022 - Brent Sass wins his first Iditarod. Facts The race ranges from 975 to 998 miles long, depending on whether the southern or northern route is being run. The length can also vary from year to year based on course conditions. The race traditionally begins on the first Saturday in March, starting in Anchorage and ending in Nome. The beginning of the race in Anchorage is considered a ceremonial start. The competitive part of the race usually begins the next day in Willow, but depends on weather conditions. There may be only one musher (person who drives the sled) per team. There are 12-14 dogs on each team. At least five dogs must be in harness (pulling the sled) at the finish line. The most commonly used sled dogs are the Samoyed, Alaskan Malamute, Siberian Husky, Alaskan Husky and Chinook. The animals get tested for strength and endurance before being selected. The musher must make a mandatory 24 hour stop at some point during the race. The route alternates every other year, one year going north through Cripple, Ruby, and Galena, the next year going south through Iditarod, Shageluk, and Anvik.

Timeline 1925 - A diphtheria outbreak in Nome, Alaska, creates an emergency need for medical supplies to be delivered, and dogsledders make the journey. The current race commemorates this mission and partially follows the same route. 1966 - Dorothy Page, President of the Wasilla-Knik Centennial Committee, decides to organize a dogsled race to celebrate Alaska's centennial in 1967. Page and Joe Redington Sr., a local musher, work together to launch the first event. 1967 - The first Iditarod is held, with 58 mushers competing along a 50-mile trail. March 1973 - After shorter races in 1967 and 1969, the first full-length race takes place. The course is approximately 1,100 miles long. The first winner is Dick Wilmarth, with a time of 20 days and 49 minutes. March 12, 2016 - A man on a snowmobile hits two teams competing in the Iditarod, killing one dog and injuring several other dogs. Alaska state troopers arrest Arnold Demoski, 26, of Nulato.

October 6, 2017 - The Iditarod Trail Committee revises Rule 39 after a musher's team of dogs test positive for an opioid drug called Tramadol. Before the rule is revised, the ITC determines that intent of the alleged musher could not be proven. The revised rule holds a musher liable for any positive canine drug test, unless they can prove that they are not at fault. The ITC later reveals four-time champion Dallas Seavey as the musher. Seavey denies the allegations. December 4, 2018 - The Iditarod Trail Committee clears Seavey of any wrongdoing and releases a statement saying, "After several meetings with Dallas Seavey, and review of all relevant information and evidence, the board does not believe that Dallas had any involvement with, or knowledge of, the events that led to the positive test in his team." 2021 - The 2021 ceremonial Mushers' Banquet is scrapped due to the coronavirus pandemic.
