Daniel Radcliffe and his girlfriend Erin Darke are going to be parents. Scott Boute, a representative for Radcliffe, confirmed to CNN on Sunday that the longtime couple are "expecting their first child." The "Harry Potter" star and Darke have been together for a decade after first meeting while filming the 2013 drama "Kill Your Darlings." Radcliffe and Darke later reunited on the set of the dramedy "Don't Think Twice" in 2016, and Darke has more recently appeared in various episodes of Radcliffe's TBS comedy series "Miracle Workers." While promoting "Weird: The Al Yankovic Story" in 2022, Radcliffe told Newsweek that he's open to exposing his kids to the magic of movie sets one day. "I want my kids, if and when they exist...I would love them to be around film sets," he said, adding that while film sets are "wonderful places" for kids, he feels the fame side of that "should be avoided at all costs." The actor was catapulted to international stardom as a child in 2001 when he starred as the titular wizard in the "Harry Potter" film franchise based off of J.K. Rowling's bestselling book series. These days, the actor has a lot to be thankful for, telling People in 2022 that he and Darke have "a really nice life." "We're really happy," he added.
