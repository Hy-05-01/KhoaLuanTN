Babanango Game Reserve: The Babanango Game Reserve is located in the KwaZulu Natal region of South Africa. In 2018, a partnership between local Zulu communities, the provincial government and a private conservation group hatched an ambitious plan to transform Babanango back into a wildlife wonderland. Brought back to life: "The KwaZulu Natal government did a survey of the land and decided it was a perfect area for a new game reserve," explains Babanango guide Xolani Mhlongo, pictured. Five years ago, the river valleys and high plains that are now safeguarded by the reserve were virtually devoid of wildlife after decades of cattle grazing and unrestrained hunting. Zulu Rock Lodge: Visitor facilities include the designer-savvy Zulu Rock Lodge. Constructed on a mountaintop, it offers cool breezes and commanding views. Park wildlife: Animals found in the reserve today include cheetah, zebra, giraffe, buffalo, hippo and black and white rhino. Babanango Valley Lodge: Visitor facilities had to be developed. There was already an old, slightly dilapidated hotel near the south entrance, which was renovated into the reserve's Babanango Valley Lodge. Historic battlefields: In addition to game drives, vsitors can sign up for bush walks, stargazing sessions, conservation helicopter flights and tours of the Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift battlefields. Babanango giraffes: Wildlife was relocated from other reserves around southern Africa. White Umfolozi River: Reserve officials hope to introduce activities like flyfishing in the Umfolozi and its tributary rivers as well as multi-day guided backpacking treks. Celebrating success: "I'm very proud of what we have accomplished so far," says Musa Mbatha, who was born and raised in a community on the edge of the present-day reserve. "I've seen a lot of changes on this land since I was a child."
