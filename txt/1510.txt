"Ruby Bridges," a film about a Black first grader who integrated an all-White elementary school in the South, is under review in a Florida school district after a parent objected to the movie's use of slurs and argued it could teach students that "White people hate Black people," according to school officials and documents obtained by CNN. CNN's Leyla Santiago has the story.
