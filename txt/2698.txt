Terry Sanderson has accused Gwyneth Paltrow of crashing into him and causing him serious injuries while they were both skiing on a Utah mountain in February 2016. Sanderson had initially sued Paltrow for $3.1 million dollars, but later amended his complaint and is now seeking in excess of $300,000 in damages, according to court documents. Paltrow is seeking $1 in damages, plus attorneys fees.
