In 2009, Coolio pled guilty to cocaine possession and agreed to enter an 18-month rehabilitation program. "Gangsta's Paradise," from the soundtrack to the film "Dangerous Minds," was among Coolio's hits. He won a Grammy in 1996 for the song. "It's one of those kinds of songs that transcends generations," he said in a 2022 interview. "I didn't use any trendy words...I think it made it timeless." Over his career, Coolio sold more than 17 million records, according to his website. He also appeared in several TV shows like "Celebrity Cook Off" and "Celebrity Chopped."
