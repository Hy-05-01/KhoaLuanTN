Christi Wolf is a writer/producer for CNN Newsroom with Fredricka Whitfield and CNN News Central with Sara Sidner, John Berman and Kate Bolduan. Prior to CNN News Central, she wrote for CNN Newsroom with Poppy Harlow and Jim Sciutto during the week. Wolf joined the Atlanta bureau in January 2012 after migrating south from Cincinnati, where she previously worked for Local 12, WKRC-TV on the assignment desk and as a digital content producer. Working as a video journalist, Wolf quickly gained newsroom and live studio experience with Don Lemon and Brooke Baldwin's show teams. From there she shifted to CNN Digital's video programming team as an associate producer. In that role, she produced, edited, wrote, curated, pitched, posted, programmed, and published online content for CNN's digital audience. Wolf was then promoted to a producer position, where she optimized content on desktop and mobile platforms for the better part of a decade. Before crossing the Mason-Dixon line, Wolf worked as a videographer near Los Angeles where she directed, filmed, edited, and produced videos for campers, with whom she had the pleasure of working. Wolf earned a bachelor of the arts degree with distinction in mass communications from Purdue University in 2010 with minors in Spanish and film and video studies. She also received the Greg Zawisza Scholarship Award that same year for excellence in telecommunications.
