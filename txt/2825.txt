'Virtually invisible': Renderings of the Pegasus concept from Jozeph Forakis Design, which has been designed to be pretty much invisible, both in design and environmental impact. Minimalist design: The vessel's interior features a "Tree of Life" that extends throughout all four decks, connected by a sculptural spiral staircase. Disappear here: The huge vessel will feature "wings" with mirrored glass that reflects its surroundings, allowing it to blend into the background. Uninterrupted views: A rendering of the interior of the yacht, which features guest lounges with huge glass panels, providing those on board with fabulous views. Perfect blend? "I was inspired to create a yacht as close to the sea and nature as possible, made of clouds floating above the waterline," says the designer in a statement. Stunning suites: Forakis estimates that the Pegasus will take around five to seven years to build if it's picked up. He hopes to be able to introduce the superyacht by 2030. Coming in 2030? "Pegasus is a bold but achievable vision for the near future of the superyacht industry, where man and machine live in harmony with nature rather than competing or compromising it," adds Forakis.
