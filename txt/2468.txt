Raffles Doha: Inspired by Qatar's national symbol, this new Doha hotel looks like two crossed scimitars. Two in one: The Katara Towers building is actually home to two luxury hotels -- the Raffles (pictured) on one side and the Fairmont on the other.

How suite it is: The Raffles is an all-suite property and uses cool shades of white and cream to provide a peaceful feeling. Lobby vibes: The hotel celebrates music, with a grand piano in the lobby. Suite escape: Every Raffles suite has 24-hour butler service. Raising the roof (bar): The penthouse of the Raffles is fittingly named Acoustic. Fairmont Doha: On the right side of the hotel is the 36-floor Fairmont. Elemental: The Fairmont bar Provok is inspired by fire and ice. Sea you: The hotel's interiors are inspired by yacht design. Eat it up: The hotel's five restaurants include French, Latin American and Japanese food. Room rating: In-room amenities include walk-in closets and Fairmont's own coffee and tea.
