Angelique Kidjo is one of three 2023 recipients of the Polar Music Prize. The Beninese singer-songwriter (pictured here performing in September 2022) becomes just the third African artist to win the prize since it began in 1992. Kidjo joins an esteemed list of musicians, including Bruce Springsteen (pictured performing in Boston, Massachusetts, in March 2023), who won the award in 1997. Paul McCartney won the prize in its inaugural year. He's pictured performing at the ACL Music Festival at Zilker Park, in Austin, Texas, in October 2018. Dizzy Gillespie, American jazz legend, won the Polar Music Prize in 1993. Pictured here during a performance in February 2023 in New York City, Yo-Yo Ma was a 2012 recipient of the prize. Nine-time Grammy winner Joni Mitchell (pictured here in 2022) was the first woman to win when she was awarded the prize in 1996. Grandmaster Flash took home the 2019 Polar Music Prize, alongside German violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter and The Playing for Change Foundation. In May 1995, Elton John took home the prize in its fourth year. The legendary artist is pictured here performing at the Grammy Awards in 2018. Senegal's Youssou N'Dour was a 2013 Polar Music Prize winner. N'Dour, pictured here on stage in Oslo, Norway in 2022, has described himself as a modern griot -- a West African tradition that is part storyteller, part oral historian and singer. British group Pink Floyd won the prize in 2008. L- R: Nick Mason, David Gilmour, Roger Waters and Rick Wright, pictured in 1973. India's Ravi Shankar performs in June 2008 in London, 10 years after winning the Polar Music Prize, which described him as having "done more than anybody else to build bridges of growing understanding and interest between Eastern and Western music." In 2002, South African singer Miriam Makeba (pictured here during a 2006 performance) became the first person from Africa to win the coveted prize. 1998 prize-winner Ray Charles is considered one of the most iconic musicians of all time. The American singer-songwriter, pictured here during an appearance on "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" in 1987, racked up 17 Grammy Award wins out of 37 total nominations. Singer, songwriter and musician Sting (pictured here on stage in Milan in 2022) won the 2017 Polar Music Prize, which called him "a true citizen of the world."
