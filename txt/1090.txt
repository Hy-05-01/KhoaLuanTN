Nashville law enforcement ended the school shooter standoff just 14 minutes after the first 9-11 call -- compared with the 81 minutes it took in Uvalde Texas. "There's a difference between one person running in and hoping for the best," says Katherine Schweit, FBI agent who created/ran the Bureau's Active Shooter Program after Sandy Hook, "and three going in, where you have all those eyes."
