Our live coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine has moved here. The deepening relationship between China and Russia was due in large part to their mutual interest in challenging the US' global influence, John Kirby, National Security Council spokesperson, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour Tuesday.   “Where they intersect is pushing back on the United States and our influence around the world," Kirby said. "Where they intersect is pushing back on this thing we call the rules-based international order. Which I know sounds kind of like a wonky term, but it’s basically the rule of law and the foundational principles of the UN charter by which nations around the world are supposed to abide. And they’re pushing back against that." Kirby's remarks come as Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin forge closer ties in Moscow in a show of unity that has heightened Western concerns that Beijing will provide cover for Russia's war in Ukraine. "They’d like to change the rules of the game," Kirby said. "And in each other they see a useful foil. They see a useful friend. But that’s what they’re doing. They’re basically trying to use each other here to challenge US leadership and the West — particularly in Europe — but elsewhere around the world.” In a joint statement released by China’s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday, Xi and Putin said their partnership is in the “fundamental interests” of both countries, adding that “Russia needs a prosperous and stable China, and China needs a strong and successful Russia.” The United States defers to Ukraine’s leadership in its prioritization of the hard-fought battle for Bakhmut, and will continue to ensure the country's president has “what he needs, wherever he chooses to fight, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Tuesday. Asked by CNN’s Christiane Amanpour whether Kyiv was spending too much time in the fight for Bakhmut, Kirby said Ukrainians are still "bravely fighting" in the eastern city and the area is "very vicious." "Here we are on the 21st of March and Bakhmut still has not fallen to the Russians," Kirby said. "So the Ukrainians are prioritizing this fight — the Russians have clearly prioritized this fight, and what we’re going do is stay focused on making sure that President [Volodymyr] Zelensky has what he needs, wherever he chooses to fight. That means intelligence. That means support. That means weapons. That means capabilities. That’s what we’re going to be focused on.” Battles to come: Ukraine is preparing to launch a spring offensive against Russian forces, built largely around the more powerful and more advanced systems Western countries have agreed to send, including tanks and other armored vehicles. Kirby said the coming weeks would be "critical," in the war and the US expected Russian President Vladimir Putin would "try to mount another offensive and maybe along many different vectors." "We have got to make sure that we are doing everything we can to make sure Ukraine is ready for that," he said. Kirby said the US wants to ensure Ukrainians can defend themselves against any renewed Russian offensive while also having the flexibility to "conduct offensive operations of their own at a time and place and a size and a scale of their choosing." "That’s where we’re taking battalions out of Ukraine right now and putting them through combined arms maneuver training," he said. "That’s why they’re ramping up training on things like the Patriot air defense system. We’re doing everything we can to make sure that they’re ready as best they can be before these critical weeks and months ahead.” Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed “serious concerns” about the security pact AUKUS grouping — comprised of Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States — and NATO, according to a joint statement released by China’s Foreign Ministry Wednesday. China and Russia also voiced concern about the nuclear-powered submarine cooperation plan among the AUKUS and urged members to “strictly fulfill their obligations not to proliferate weapons of mass destruction.” The leaders raised serious concerns about NATO’s “continuous strengthening of military-security ties with Asia-Pacific countries” and said they “oppose external military forces undermining regional peace and stability.” In the statement, the countries emphasized their partnership is in the “fundamental interests” of both countries, adding that “Russia needs a prosperous and stable China, and China needs a strong and successful Russia.” The leaders also said they will develop a closer energy partnership and continue to strengthen their cooperation in the financial sector. In regard to Ukraine, both sides pointed out in the statement that to resolve the crisis, “the legitimate security concerns of all countries must be respected, and camp confrontation and fueling the fire must be prevented." ##Xi In Moscow## Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping held official joint events in the Kremlin Tuesday, where the two pledged to deepen China-Russia ties. The show of unity has heightened concerns that Beijing will provide cover for Russia's war in Ukraine. In fact, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday the alliance has "seen some signs" that Russia has likely requested lethal aid from China to bolster Moscow’s war in Ukraine. During their joint events Tuesday, the two leaders also called for an end to actions that “increase tensions” and prolong the war in Ukraine, attended a state dinner and signed a joint declaration on deepening their partnership. Here are other headlines: Surveillance drones. The United States is flying surveillance drones further south above the Black Sea after a Russian jet collided with a US drone last week, according to two US officials. The drone flights have remained in international airspace, but since the collision, the US has moved its drone flights further away from airspace surrounding the Crimean peninsula and eastern portions of the Black Sea. Russian strikes. Three people were injured in a Russian missile attack on the Odesa region on Tuesday, according to Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office in Ukraine. The fight for Bakhmut. The eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut remains the focus of Russia's attacks. A Ukrainian army major in the area said the situation remains extremely difficult in the city, but he believes the Russians are losing their "offensive potential." Military aid. The US has changed course and is now providing Ukraine with 31 M1-A1 Abrams tanks instead of the newer M1-A2 variants previously planned, Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said Tuesday. Patriot missile defense systems are also set to be deployed to Ukraine faster than originally planned, and a group of 65 Ukrainian soldiers will complete their training on the systems at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in the coming days, US defense officials said on Tuesday. But Ukraine has more requests: A senior Ukrainian air force official said the country needs modern combat aircraft as it squeezes the most out of its diminishing Soviet-era fleet. The United States is flying surveillance drones further south above the Black Sea after a Russian jet collided with a US drone last week, according to two US officials The drone flights have remained in international airspace, but since the collision between one of the Russian jets and the MQ-9 Reaper drone last Tuesday, the US has moved its drone flights further away from airspace surrounding the Crimean peninsula and eastern portions of the Black Sea. One of the officials said the routes are part of an effort “to avoid being too provocative,” as the Biden administration remains careful to avoid an incident that could potentially escalate into a direct conflict between US and Russian forces. The official said the drone flights would continue this way “for the time being,” but added there is already “an appetite” to return to the routes closer to Russian-held territory. The officials also said Russia may try to unilaterally declare a broader closure of airspace around southern and eastern Ukraine in an attempt to force US drone flights further out.   On Tuesday, FlightRadar24, a commercial flight tracking website, showed a US RQ-4 Global Hawk — which is a remotely-piloted aircraft used for surveillance — remaining in the southern and southwestern portions of the Black Sea at an altitude of approximately 52,000 feet. Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said Tuesday the US was continuing to operate drones of the Black Sea, “flying in international airspace in accordance with international law.” But he declined to say whether the US had changed its routes or mission profiles following last week’s encounter between a US spy drone and two Russian fighter jets.  “I’m not going to, for operational security reasons, not going to get into the specifics of routes, missions, timelines, things like that,” Ryder said at a press briefing. Memorial, a Russian human rights group, said one of its leading figures was arrested in Moscow on Tuesday and faces charges of discrediting the Russian armed forces. A criminal case has been opened against Oleg Orlov, 69, co-chairman of Memorial Human Rights Defence Center, the group tweeted. He was later released on bail. Memorial said Orlov's case was opened under allegations he repeatedly discredited the Russian military. A journalist asked Orlov why he was being detained, to which he responded: "It's related to accusation against me that I support Nazism. An idiotic idea!" Orlov had reposted an article he wrote for a French publication in November 2022 on his Facebook page. The article was entitled “They wanted fascism. They got it." Memorial was banned in Russia in late 2021. Last year it shared the Nobel Peace Prize for its “outstanding effort to document war crimes, human right abuses and the abuse of power." The White House rejected China’s claim to hold an impartial position in the war in Ukraine following a summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Moscow. “I don't think you can reasonably look at China as impartial in any way,” said John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman. Earlier, Xi said that Beijing held an impartial position in the war after lengthy talks with Putin in Moscow. The United States held a skeptical view of the summit, particularly China’s stated goal of acting as a peacemaker. Kirby said if China wanted to play a constructive role, it would use its influence to urge Russia to end the war. Biden “wants to keep the lines of communication open with China” and will speak with Xi “at the appropriate time,” Kirby said. US officials are still digesting the language of the joint statement released following the Xi-Putin meeting, but Kirby said there was little optimism at the summit’s conclusions.  “We haven't seen anything that they've said, they put forward, that gives us hope that this war is going to end anytime soon,” he said. ##Xi In Moscow## Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office in Ukraine, said three people were injured in a Russian missile attack on the Odesa region on Tuesday. Yermak posted on Telegram: "Russians struck Odesa with four missiles. Kh-59, according to preliminary reports." "Two missiles have been intercepted by air defence. Two more hit the city, unfortunately." He said a three-story building was damaged on the premises of a monastery. Yurii Kruk, head of the Odesa district military administration said "the enemy" carried out a rocket strike in the region with SU-35 fighters launching missiles from the sea. "Some rockets were intercepted thanks to our air defences. However, there was a strike that resulted in partial damage to civilian building. There are wounded. No one was killed, according to preliminary reports," he said. Unofficial social media reports indicate that the missiles were aimed at an airfield in the region. International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan said he believes Russia is treating children like “spoils of war." Last week, the ICC announced arrest warrants against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian children's rights commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova for their roles in allegedly illegally deporting Ukrainian children to Russia. The Rome Statute of the Geneva Conventions makes it clear "you can’t deport civilians to a foreign country,” Khan said. Moscow has rejected the warrants, with a spokesperson for the ministry of foreign affairs previously saying that “Russia is not a member of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and bears no obligations under it." “You must look after them," Khan said of Ukrainian children. "If they are not safe, you move them to a safe part of Ukraine. If that’s not possible, a neutral third country. And it seems to be not just deportation to Russian Federation, they’re met by strangers who now have suddenly become adopted parents. And the children are not property, they’re not the spoils of war.”  The prosecutor said Russia does not seem to be denying the allegations against it but rather wearing it “like a badge of honor." “Children are not the property of a country to be dispatched based on politics or some ideological motives. It needs to be regulated by law, and that law needs to be enforced,” Khan said.  He said the ICC has since reached out to Russia, but it has not heard back. A Ukrainian army major in the Bakhmut area says the situation remains extremely difficult, but that he believes the Russians are losing their "offensive potential." Maksym Zhorin said on his Telegram channel that "the main task for the Ukrainian army is to hold the connection corridor, which allows for the supply and evacuation of the wounded." "Therefore the fighting around this corridor, in the area of Ivankivske and Bohdanivka, is the most difficult," he said. The two villages sit on routes west from Bakhmut toward the city of Kostiantynivka. "One thing I can say for sure is that the enemy is gradually running out of offensive potential," Zhorin said. "They have sustained significant losses while trying to advance in the South and in the North, as well as while trying to attack directly through urban areas. Nevertheless, the endless assault attempts continue." "The Russians have a goal to take Bakhmut at any cost. We have orders to hold the line. We are following our orders." Chinese President Xi Jinping has left the Kremlin following a state dinner on Tuesday evening with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to footage on Russian state media. “Together, we should push forward these changes that have not happened for 100 years. Take care,” the Chinese leader said during a goodbye handshake with Putin. ##Xi In Moscow## Talks between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin continued Tuesday as Western leaders closely monitored day two of Xi's three-day Moscow visit. Let's catch up on what happened today: The China-Russia partnership: Putin called Xi a "friend" who he is "in constant contact" with and described all discussions in the Moscow meetings as "successful." Xi said he has built a "close relationship" with Putin over the past decade. The visit is a show of unity that has heightened Western concerns Beijing will provide cover for Russia's war in Ukraine. What the leaders said about Ukraine: Xi and Putin called for an end to actions that “increase tensions” and prolong the war in Ukraine, according to a readout released by Chinese state media People’s Daily. The two leaders also took part in a document-signing ceremony at the Kremlin, where they said the Ukrainian crisis should be solved through peace talks, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. A state dinner and a toast: To wrap up the second day of talks, Putin and Xi attended a state dinner. Putin gave a speech in which he toasted the health of Xi and the Chinese delegation, the “deepening of the Russian-Chinese partnership and strategic cooperation” and “the prosperity of the Russian and Chinese people.” A likely aid request: NATO has "seen some signs" that Russia has likely requested lethal aid from China to bolster Moscow’s war in Ukraine, the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Tuesday. Xi's three-day visit to Moscow signals the closer ties developing between China and Russia, he said. Meanwhile, in Ukraine: The eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut remains the focus of Russia's attacks. Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN that Russian troops would have an "open road" to capture key cities in eastern Ukraine if they seized control of Bakhmut. A faster timeline for US tanks and missiles: Patriot missile defense systems are also set to be deployed to Ukraine faster than originally planned, and a group of 65 Ukrainian soldiers will complete their training on the systems at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in the coming days, US defense officials said on Tuesday. The acceleration of Patriot deployments comes the same day the US said it will accelerate the time it takes to ship Abrams tanks to Ukraine by sending older M1-A1 models of America's main battle tank instead of the more modern version, according to two US officials. ##Xi In Moscow## ##Catch Up## The US has changed course and is now providing Ukraine with 31 M1-A1 Abrams tanks instead of the newer M1-A2 variants previously planned, Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said Tuesday. “[A]fter further study and analysis on how best to do this, DoD in close coordination with Ukraine has made the decision to provide the M1-A1 variant of the Abrams tank, which will enable us to submit significantly expedite delivery timelines and deliver this important capability to Ukraine by the fall of this year,” Ryder said at a press conference.  He added that the US would also be providing Ukraine with “advances armor and weapons systems” that are “very similar capability” to the M1-A2, including a .50-caliber heavy machine gun and 120 mm cannon. The UK Ministry of Defense said Russia is “deliberately trying to disinform” after President Vladimir Putin warned the UK against providing Ukraine with ammunition that contains depleted uranium. Baroness Annabel Goldie, the UK Minister of State at the Ministry of Defense, announced the aid in a statement Monday. “I would like to note that if all this happens, Russia will have to react accordingly," Putin said during a news conference Tuesday alongside his Chinese counterpart. "I mean that the collective West is already starting to use weapons with a nuclear component,” referencing that the shells have depleted uranium. In response, a UK MOD spokesperson said, “the British Army has used depleted uranium in its armour-piercing shells for decades. It is a standard component and has nothing to do with nuclear weapons or capabilities. Russia knows this, but is deliberately trying to disinform.” “Independent research by scientists from groups such as the Royal Society has assessed that any impact to personal health and the environment from the use of depleted uranium munitions is likely to be low,” the spokesperson stated. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping arrived at the state dinner in Moscow Tuesday, following the second day of talks between the two leaders. “Russia-Chinese relations are at the highest point ever,” Putin said in an opening speech at the state dinner. He added that the cooperation between the two counties has “limitless possibilities and prospects.” Putin ended his speech by toasting to the “health” of Xi and the Chinese delegation, the “deepening of the Russian-Chinese partnership and strategic cooperation” and “the prosperity of the Russian and Chinese people.” ##Xi In Moscow## Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin are calling for an end to actions that “increase tensions” and prolong the war in Ukraine, according to a readout released by Chinese state media People’s Daily of the two leaders meeting in Moscow Tuesday. According to the readout, Russia spoke positively about China’s “objective and fair” stance on Ukraine and both sides opposed any country or group of countries harming the “legitimate security interests of other countries in pursuit of military, political or other advantages.” Russia reiterated its commitment to resuming peace talks as soon as possible, which China appreciated, according to People’s Daily. Russia also welcomed China playing an “active role” in finding a solution to the conflict in Ukraine through political and diplomatic means, including some of the measures China proposed in its 12-point peace plan. Both leaders said that the “legitimate security concerns of all countries” must be respected when it comes to how to end the war and attempts that “add fuel to fire” as well as “confrontation between blocs” must be prevented, the readout said. Both sides also opposed any unilateral sanctions unauthorized by the United Nations Security Council.  ##Xi In Moscow## Chinese President Xi Jinping said he has built a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past 10 years. "I reviewed the results of relations between our two countries in the past 10 years with President Putin. We agreed that the relations between our two nations go way beyond ourselves. They are crucial to the world order and all mankind's future and destiny," Xi said during remarks in Moscow on Tuesday following the signing of a joint declaration of cooperation. "Since last year, the Sino-Russian comprehensive pragmatic cooperation has achieved great results. It continues to show that this cooperation has a solid base, is very complimentary and very tough," Xi continued, adding that trade volume between the two countries increased by 116% compared to a decade ago. ##Xi In Moscow## China’s proposal for a peace plan in Ukraine, “can be taken as the basis for a peaceful settlement in Ukraine, when the West and in Kyiv are ready for it,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday. "We believe in many of the points on the peace plan put forward by China,” he added. Putin said he also discussed sanctions with his Chinese counterpart. “When we discussed international problems, we stated that Russia and China’s views are converging and very close on a number of them,” Putin said. “Tension in a number of regions in the world is increasing, the conflict and crisis potential is growing, the practice of using illegitimate politically motivated sanctions and other restrictions is expanding.” “China and Russia are against any states violating the interest of other countries for the sake of military, political or economic benefit,” Putin said. ##Xi In Moscow## Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that he is “in constant contact" with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. This “enables us to find any solutions even in the most difficult situation to all problems,” Putin said, calling China a “stable trade partner.” China is the “leading destination for import of Russian oil,” he added. Putin also said cooperation with China in nuclear energy is increasing. ##Xi In Moscow## Russian President Vladimir Putin kicked off his speech to reporters following two days of meetings with his Chinese counterpart by calling Xi Jinping a “friend.” “All our talks today, and yesterday in one-to-one format, and with delegations, were successful and took place in friendly atmosphere,” Putin said.  The two leaders moments earlier signed a joint declaration on deepening partnership. “The two key statements we have just signed fully reflect the nature of Russian-Chinese relations, which are at their highest level of development and are an exemplary of a true comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation. Russia and China are bound by strong ties of good neighborhood, mutual assistance and support between our nations. We maintain an active bilateral dialogue at all levels,” Putin said. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping have signed a joint declaration "on key aspects of the Sino-Russian economic cooperation plan by 2030," according to Chinese state media on Tuesday. The two leaders took part in the document signing ceremony in the Malachite Hall at the Grand Kremlin Palace The leaders emphasized that the Ukrainian crisis should be solved through peace talks, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. ##Xi In Moscow## Patriot missile defense systems are set to be deployed to Ukraine faster than originally planned, and a group of 65 Ukrainian soldiers will complete their training on the systems at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in the coming days, US defense officials said on Tuesday. The troops will then move on to Europe for additional training on the two Patriot systems—one American, and one built by the Germans and Dutch— that will be deployed to Ukraine in the coming weeks, the officials told reporters at Fort Sill. US trainers at Fort Sill, where the 65 Ukrainians have been training since January 15, were able to significantly speed up the timeline of the course because of the Ukrainians’ baseline knowledge of air defense systems, the officials said. The acceleration of Patriot deployments comes the same day it was reported that the US will accelerate the time it takes to ship Abrams tanks to Ukraine by sending older M1-A1 models of America's main battle tank instead of the more modern version of the tank, according to two US officials. “Our assessment is that the Ukrainian soldiers are impressive, and absolutely a quick study,” said Brig. Gen. Shane Morgan, the Fort Sill commander. “Due to their extensive air defense knowledge and experience in a combat zone, it was easier— though never easy—for them to grasp the Patriot System Operations and Maintenance concepts.”  The US military had allocated 10 weeks for the training, but the Ukrainians completed it in about 8 weeks. The training schedule was “aggressive,” a Fort Sill official said, with the Ukrainians training daily from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time. Moscow is ready to support Chinese businesses in replacing Western companies that have left Russia since it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday ahead of expanded talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. “We are ready to support Chinese business in replacing Western enterprises that left Russia,” Putin said. Some background: Dozens of the world’s biggest companies abandoned or scaled back their operations in Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. The exodus affected every corner of the economy, from its vast energy riches through autos, finance, retail, entertainment and fast food, starving Russia of new investment and removing products and services that had become popular in the decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Some high-profile exist were by Apple, Ford and BP. See the list here. ##Xi In Moscow## Ahead of the start of scheduled expanded negotiations with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that the two leaders had “substantive” and “frank” discussions so far. “Last night, we had a substantive conversation about the entire comprehensive agenda between our countries and the urgent international and regional problems,” Putin said in his opening statement. “Having just met in a narrow circle we had a frank and full discussion and exchanged views on the future development of Russian-Chinese ties and the strengthening of coordination on the international scene,” he said. Next, the two leaders are next going to have “a detailed examination of the practical aspects of our cooperation in various areas in extended meeting between our delegations,” Putin said, including a plan for the development of key areas of Russian-Chinese economic cooperation until 2030. Additionally, Putin told Xi that Russia is “able to meet the growing demand of Chinese economy for energy resources.” ##Xi In Moscow## Russia and China are pushing for further cooperation and that the countries are seeing “early results” of their cooperation, Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. "Our areas of cooperation continue to expand and our consensus continue to deepen. We are seeing early results of our cooperation and further works are under full implementation," Xi said.  According to a Chinese state media readout, in a meeting earlier Tuesday Xi told Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin that China and Russia should enhance and expand economic and trade cooperation, and "jointly safeguard our two countries’ energy security." ##Xi In Moscow## The US will dramatically accelerate the time it takes to ship Abrams tanks to Ukraine by sending older M1-A1 models of America’s main battle tank instead of the more modern version of the tank, according to two US officials.  The switch will allow the tanks to arrive as early as the fall of this year, one of the officials said, shaving months off the previous timeline that could have taken a year or longer. On Tuesday morning, the National Security Council’s strategic communications coordinator John Kirby said that the US was working to speed up the delivery of tanks to Ukraine.   “We're working on that. There's some changes that you can make to the process, to sort of speed that up,” Kirby said on MSNBC. “The Pentagon is working as fast as they can, and they'll have more to say on adjustments they're making.” More on the tanks: The US had previously announced it would send the more modern M1-A2 version of the Abrams battle tank, but that would have required either building new tanks or modernizing existing older tanks, then training Ukrainian crews on the more advanced system. The M1-A2 has a newer digital targeting system that makes it a more capable tank, but it also required more training for Ukrainian troops to operate the more complex tank and to maintain the system.  The decision to speed up the delivery of tanks comes as Ukraine is preparing to launch a spring offensive against Russian forces, built largely around the more powerful and more advanced systems Western countries have agreed to send, including tanks and other armored vehicles.  The US still intends to send 31 M1-A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, the same number as previously announced. The size of a complete Ukrainian tank battalion.   What other US officials have said: In mid-February, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said these systems would “make a pretty significant difference” in Ukraine’s anticipated counteroffensive. Austin urged other countries last week to send tanks and other armored vehicles to Ukraine as soon as possible. Last month, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth had said all of the options the US was considering to get tanks to Ukraine would take months. “We’re looking at options for how to get the Ukrainians tanks and there are a variety of different ways that we could do that,” Wormuth told a group of reporters at the time. “We’re looking at what’s the fastest way we can get the tanks to the Ukrainians. It’s not going to be a matter of weeks.” But she warned that even the faster options still involve ��longer timelines” that may take more than a year. Reuters first reported the decision to send the older Abrams tanks. China and Russia should enhance and expand economic and trade cooperation, and also jointly safeguard both countries’ energy security, Chinese leader Xi Jinping told Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin in a meeting Tuesday, according to a Chinese state media readout.  “We must fully utilize the spillover effects of major interconnecting projects, jointly safeguard our two countries’ energy security and expand our bilateral trade exchanges,” Xi said in a statement, adding that China and Russia should also enhance cooperation in scientific and technological innovation.  What Moscow is saying: Russia, on the other hand, is ready for closer cooperation with China in various areas, including trade, energy, natural gas, “peaceful use” of nuclear power, space technology, technological innovation, cross-border transportation, food security and supply chain security, Mishustin said, according to the stateme
