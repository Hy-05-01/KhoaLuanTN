The residents of Maksymilyanivka, Ukraine, have lived under the constant threat of shelling for more than a year. Yet every Sunday a small handful emerge from their homes, or bomb shelters, to attend church services overseen by a flak-jacket clad pastor who brings them hope, and fresh bread. CNN's Ben Wedeman followed the pastor to the village, where a rushed, no-frills service of a sermon and prayer in a bomb-scarred church provides war-weary residents with a momentary sense of serenity.
