The best of the worst in cinema were celebrated Saturday with the announcement of the winners of the 43rd Annual Razzie Awards. Netflix's Marilyn Monroe inspired biopic "Blonde," the critically panned Jared Leto film "Morbius" and Baz Luhrman's "Elvis" each won two awards, including one for Tom Hanks for his portrayal of Elvis' manager, Colonel Tom Parker. This year the awards also gave themselves a trophy for their blunder in nominating a child in the worst actress category. In January the folks behind the Golden Raspberry Awards (as the Razzies are formerly known) apologized and removed child actor Ryan Kiera Armstrong from their annual list of nominees. Armstrong had been nominated for worst actress for her performance in "Firestarter," and there was backlash given that Armstrong was only 12 years old at the time. "Sometimes, you do things without thinking, Then you are called out for it. Then you get it. It's why the Razzies were created in the first place," Razzies co-founder John B. Wilson said in a statement at the time. Below is list of winniers, which, as per tradition, is always released the day before the Academy Awards.
