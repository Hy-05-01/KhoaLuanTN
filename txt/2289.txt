Artificial environment engineering company Interstellar Lab believes it has the solution for growing crops on Mars -- the Nutritional Closed-Loop Eco-Unit System or "NUCLEUS." The modular structure is composed of nine cube capsules and is designed to provide a nutritious diet for four astronauts for the duration of a two-year mission, using the principles of vertical farming. According to CEO Barbara Belvisi, it is capable of producing fresh microgreens, vegetables, mushrooms, and even edible insects. This Crop One facility in Dubai is the world's largest vertical farming operation, and showcases how the technique can allow for efficient crop growth in limited space. Vertical farming delivers nutrient-rich water directly to a plant's roots. This can vastly reduce water and fertilizer usage compared to traditional outdoor agriculture. According to Crop One, its Dubai farm produces 1 million kilograms (over 2 million pounds) of crops annually. The farm cultivates a variety of greens, such as kale, spinach and arugula. On a small scale, astronauts are already growing crops aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Pictured here, Kayla Barron works on a space agriculture experiment aboard the ISS. Astronauts have succeeded in growing small crops of leafy greens in a nutrient-rich substrate inside sealed chambers, using artificial lights. Pictured here, astronaut Jessica Meir cuts leaves from plants grown in microgravity. Pictured, NASA astronaut and flight engineer Kate Rubins checks out radish plants growing on the space station. Astronauts aren't only growing vegetables on the ISS. Pictured, Scott Kelly harvests space-grown zinnias. It was part of a study investigating growing edible crops on long-duration space missions.
