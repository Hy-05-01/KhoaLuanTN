A toxic train wreck in Ohio ignited a dayslong inferno, spewed poisonous fumes into the air, killed thousands of fish and left residents wondering if it's safe to live in East Palestine. The fiery derailment in early February prompted fears of a catastrophic explosion of vinyl chloride -- a highly flammable chemical linked to an increased risk of cancer. After a mandatory evacuation order, crews released vinyl chloride into a trench and burned it off -- averting an explosion but spawning new health concerns.

CNN is chronicling the latest events as new information unfolds.
