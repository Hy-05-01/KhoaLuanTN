Today CNN 10 is examining the destruction in Mississippi after powerful storms and at least one major tornado pummeled the Southeast, leaving a wake of destruction. The storm destroyed some towns entirely and killed and injured residents. Then, CNN 10 is looking to the sky, to see a rare phenomenon called a "planetary parade." And a tech company wants to revolutionize home delivery through drones, but the Federal Aviation Agency has hampered plans in the past. All that and the story of a dairy cow gone viral because she hates getting up early in the morning on this episode of CNN 10.
