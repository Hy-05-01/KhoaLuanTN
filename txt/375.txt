In a surprise announcement, actress Emmy Rossum shared on Thursday that she and producer husband Sam Esmail have welcomed a new member to their family. "On a foggy Wednesday morning, our son was born," Rossum posted on her verified Instagram account, noting the child's April 5 birth date. Rossum's post also included snapshots of her son's newborn footprints, her pregnant belly, and a sweet black and white photo of the baby snuggled up in a blanket. The couple are also parents to a 22-month-old daughter. The announcement comes as a surprise to the general public. Rossum kept the news secret that she and "Mr. Robot" creator Esmail were expecting until Thursday's birth announcement. What's not a surprise, however, is that Rossum was able to pull off such a feat. In May 2021, Rossum delivered the news that they had welcomed their daughter on Instagram after never previously sharing that she was pregnant. The "Shameless" star is notoriously private but posted a moving message on Mother's Day last year that included photos of her daughter. "The first year has been full of playing, crawling, eating, carrying pacifiers in mouths and holding hands. I am so deeply grateful to be your mom," her post read. Esmail directed Rossum in the 2014 romantic comedy "Comet" before proposing to her the following year. The couple wed in New York in 2017.
