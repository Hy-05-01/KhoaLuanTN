Here's a look at Kashmir, a region in the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain ranges. India, Pakistan and China all claim partial or complete ownership of Kashmir. Facts Kashmir is an 86,000-square mile region in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. India and Pakistan have been fighting over Kashmir since both countries gained their independence in 1947. Between 1989 and 2008, more than 47,000 people were killed in separatist violence, according to the Indian government. Some human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations say the death toll is higher. Hundreds are still killed every year in separatist violence, according to human rights groups. The Line of Control separates Indian and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir. India-controlled: One state, called Jammu and Kashmir, makes up the southern and eastern portions of the region. Srinagar is the summer capital city. Jammu (city) is the winter capital. Pakistan-controlled: Three areas called Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan make up the northern and western portions of the region. The capital of Azad Kashmir is Muzaffarabad. China-controlled: One area called Aksai Chin in the northernmost part of the region.
