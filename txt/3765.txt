A 14-year-old was killed and two other teens were hospitalized Tuesday after a vehicle crashed into them while they were riding horses that the Dallas Police Department says were stolen. Two of the horses also died, Dallas Police said in a news release. Police responded to the crash at Great Trinity Forest and Julius Schepps Freeway around 5:30 a.m. Tuesday, the release said. "The preliminary investigation has determined the three riders appear to be juveniles and the horses were stolen," it added. The 14-year-old died at the scene, while the two other riders -- a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old -- were taken to a local hospital, where they remain in stable condition, per police. One of the horses also died at the scene, police said, and the second was euthanized on scene by a veterinarian. The third horse was injured, too, police said, but is expected to live. The driver is not expected to face charges, according to police. The investigation remains ongoing.
