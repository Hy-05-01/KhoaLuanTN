Seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady has acquired an ownership stake in the WNBA's Las Vegas Aces, team owner Mark Davis announced Thursday. "I am very excited to be part of the Las Vegas Aces organization," said Brady in a statement on Thursday. "I have always been a huge fan of women's sports, and I admire the work that the Aces' players, staff, and the WNBA continue to do to grow the sport and empower future generations of athletes. To be able to contribute in any way to that mission as a member of the Aces organization is an incredible honor." Brady said his love for women's sports grew out of watching his older sisters, who were "by far the best athletes in our house!" Brady announced his retirement from the NFL in February after 23 seasons with the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. During his long career, the three-time league MVP set almost every passing record, including regular season passing yards (89,214) and passing touchdowns (649). He has also amassed the most wins of any player in NFL history (251). "Since I purchased the Aces, our goal has been to win on and off the court," said Davis, who also owns the NFL's Las Vegas Raiders. "Tom Brady is a win not only for the Aces, and the WNBA, but for women's professional sports as a whole." Davis purchased the WNBA franchise before the 2021 season. Brady's partial acquisition of the team is subject to WNBA approval. The Aces enter the upcoming season as reigning WNBA champions. The team opens the season against the Seattle Storm on May 20 at Climate Pledge Arena in Washington. In October, Brady joined the ownership group of an expansion Major League Pickleball team, along with former tennis World No. 1 Kim Clijsters, who in December attended the draft to support their new squad, the Las Vegas Night Owls.
