Investigators found a suicide note when they searched the home of the shooter who killed six people at a Nashville school last week, along with weapons and ammunition, according to an inventory items authorities seized while executing a search warrant at the residence. The search warrant and the list of items found were released Tuesday, just over a week after the shooter, identified as Audrey Hale, stormed the Covenant School armed with three firearms and killed three 9-year-olds and three adults. The 28-year-old Hale, who police said was under care for an emotional disorder, had legally purchased seven firearms and hidden them at home, Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief John Drake previously said. This is a developing story and will be updated.
