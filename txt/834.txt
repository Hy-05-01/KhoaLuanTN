Welcome to Sazenka: This Tokyo restaurant is the world's only three-Michelin-star Chinese restaurant in a non-Chinese-speaking city. The restaurant's regional Chinese dishes, including Cantonese char siu (honey-glazed roast pork), pictured, are infused with a uniquely Japanese spirit. A childhood dream: Chef Kawada's love for Chinese food took seed when he was just five years old, after his parents took him to a Chinese restaurant in Japan's Tochigi prefecture. "I was so impressed by it that I decided I would become a Chinese chef in the future," he says. Kawada's culinary journey: Kawada worked inside the kitchen of Azabu Choko, a now-closed Sichuanese restaurant in Tokyo for a decade before switching to Japanese cuisine and training under chef Seiji Yamamoto of RyuGin for five years. His deep understanding of the two cuisines is reflected in his dishes. A Tokyo first: The restaurant's poetic name, Sazenka, is made up three words that mean tea, zen and Chinese. It was awarded two stars by the Michelin Guide in 2017 -- the same year it opened. Another star was added in 2020 and it has held on to all three in the years since. Pheasant soup: Inspired by Hong Kong's wonton soup, Sazenka's version of the dish takes time to create. Pheasant bones are pounded and soaked in water overnight. They're then boiled down for about four hours. The broth will need to rest for another day before minced pheasant meat, Jinhua-cured ham, kelp, green onions, ginger, 15-year-old Shaoxing wine, salt and pepper are added to season the clear stock. It's all about harmony: Kawada explains Sazenka's cuisine by drawing a yin-yang symbol. "It isn't fusion but harmony," he says, noting the importance of balancing the two cultures' cuisines rather than blending them.
