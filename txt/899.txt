Before CNN, he worked at ABC News for nearly 17 years, and appeared on television there since 2001. He was a regular contributor to all of ABC's broadcasts, including World News with Diane Sawyer, Good Morning America, Nightline, and 20/20. In 1999 and 2000, Berman worked as an off-air reporter for ABC News covering George W. Bush's presidential campaign. He logged more hours with then-candidate Bush than nearly any other reporter, following Bush to 45 states. In his career, he has interviewed everyone from Barack Obama to Mike Pence to Mitt Romney to MC Hammer. He was embedded with the Marines for the U.S. Invasion of Iraq in 2003, and has covered countless hurricanes and natural disasters. From 1997 to 1999, Berman was the head writer for World News Tonight with Peter Jennings. He has also been part of teams winning the Edward R. Murrow Award for best broadcast, and was awarded a James Beard Award in 2010. Berman started at ABC News as a desk assistant working the overnight shift in 1995. A native of Carlisle, Mass., he graduated from Harvard University, where he was president of Hasty Pudding Theatricals. He likes the Red Sox. Have a problem with that?
