Look up: Palazzo della Meridiana often hosts exhibitions. Alley cats: Genoa is home to what's said to be Europe's largest medieval city center, full of alleys so narrow cars can't fit through. Ancient and modern: Via Garibaldi 12 is a contemporary design store in a Rolli Palace. First impressions: The palaces on Via Garibaldi are spectacular -- like this entranceway to Palazzo Nicolosio Lomellino. Red Palace: Palazzo Rosso, or 'Red Palace,' reopened as a museum after renovations in 2022. Colossal: The palaces had huge courtyards and entrance halls, designed to be accessed via horse-drawn carriage. Modern life: Palazzo Imperiale, at the end of the street, houses an antiques store, architectural studio, and a bar. New town: Genoa's "modern" part of the city is Art Nouveau. Timelapse: Walk along Via Garibaldi and you'll be walking along a street that hasn't changed since the 1600s. Cultural hub: Palazzo Bianco is a "scattered" museum, alongside Palazzo Rosso and Palazzo Tursi. New life: Palazzo Bianco has been repurposed as a city-owned art gallery. Fit for royalty: Palazzo Reale is also open to the public as a museum.
