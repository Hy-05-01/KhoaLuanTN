Major League Baseball (MLB) is investigating an altercation between Los Angeles Angels third baseman Anthony Rendon and a fan during the team's Opening Day game against the Oakland Athletics on Thursday. In a video posted on social media, Rendon appeared to grab a fan by the shirt and allege the fan called him a "b*tch." Rendon then tried to take a swipe at the fan before walking away. There are no videos that appear to show the lead-up to the incident. "We are aware of the video and we are now looking into the matter," an MLB spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. The Angels declined to comment on the matter and told CNN the team is expecting Rendon to address the media before Saturday's game in Oakland. The 32-year-old Rendon went 0-3 with a walk in the team's 2-1 loss on Thursday. Rendon is in his fourth year with the Angels after signing with the club for the 2020 season and missed most of last season with a wrist injury.
