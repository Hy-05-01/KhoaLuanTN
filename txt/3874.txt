Our live coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine has moved here. The future of Ukraine is being decided in the eastern part of the country where the fighting is “very tough," President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday. The Ukrainian military said fighting around the eastern city of Bakhmut is relentless with Ukrainian troops clearing Russian trenches in close-quarters combat. Here are the top headlines: Training on tanks: The first group of Ukrainian soldiers training to operate and maintain Spain’s Leopard 2A4 tanks will finish their instruction this week, the Spanish Ministry of Defense said. Spain agreed to send six of its Leopard 2A4 main battle tanks to Ukraine, part of a coordinated effort with Germany, Norway, Poland, Portugal and the Netherlands, to supply Kyiv with around 80 Leopard 2 vehicles. Germany will supply Ukraine with 18 of the more advanced Leopard 2A6 variant. War crimes: The International Criminal Court is planning to open two war crimes cases tied to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and issue arrest warrants against “several people,” according to the New York Times and Reuters, citing current and former officials with knowledge of the decision who were not authorized to speak publicly. Latest on the grain deal: Russia and the United Nations have agreed to a 60-day extension of the Ukraine grain deal after negotiations in Geneva, Russian state news agency RIA reported. Ukraine and Russia are both significant suppliers of food to the world. According to data from the European Commission, about 90% of these exports were shipped from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. The war and its impact on grain exports, therefore, has major implications, particularly in the global South which relies heavily on them. Putin ally visits Iran: Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko visited Iran — something the US said it is watching closely. Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, met with President Ebrahim Raisi, according to Belarusian state media, and the two “signed a roadmap for comprehensive cooperation between the countries for 2023-2026.” China and Ukraine: Meantime, the US has been encouraging Chinese President Xi Jinping to speak directly with Zelensky, the White House said, amid reports the Chinese leader would hold a call with the Ukrainian leader.  ##Catch Up## President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country’s future is being decided in eastern Ukraine, where the fighting is “very tough.” “The situation in the east is very tough and very painful. We need to destroy the enemy's military power, and we will,” he said in his nightly address Monday. “Bilohorivka and Maryinka, Avdiivka and Bakhmut, Vuhledar and Kamyanka — and all other places where our future is being decided. Where our future, the future of all Ukrainians, is being fought for.” Zelensky went on to say he was grateful to every soldier putting their lives on the line in these battles. “I thank everyone who is defending their positions and fighting for Ukraine and their brothers,” he said. “Thank you to everyone who never lets down those who are next to them on the line!” “Today, I would like to recognize the soldiers of the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade for their successful actions in the area of Bakhmut,” the Ukrainian president added.  ##Bakhmut## The first group of Ukrainian soldiers training to operate and maintain Spain’s Leopard 2A4 tanks will finish their instruction this week, the Spanish Ministry of Defense said in a statement Monday. The first group includes 10 complete crews and support staff, consisting of 55 soldiers in total. “These courses were launched after the Spanish commitment to contribute to the Ukrainian defensive effort with the contribution of tanks was formalized,” the statement read. “At that time, Ukraine requested the training of crews and maintenance personnel for the operational deployment of the contributed Leopard 2A main battle tanks.” Some more context: Spain agreed to send six of its Leopard 2A4 main battle tanks to Ukraine, part of a coordinated effort with Germany, Norway, Poland, Portugal and the Netherlands, to supply Kyiv with around 80 Leopard 2 vehicles. Germany will supply Ukraine with 18 of the more advanced Leopard 2A6 variant.    The visit by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko to Iran is “in some ways, an extension of the deepening relationship between Iran and Russia,” US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Monday. “It's something we're watching very closely. These are two birds of a feather and oftentimes they do flock together,” Price said at a State Department briefing. Belarus’ leader, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, met in Tehran on Monday with President Ebrahim Raisi, according to Belarusian state media, and the two “signed a roadmap for comprehensive cooperation between the countries for 2023-2026.” The US has been encouraging Chinese President Xi Jinping to speak directly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the White House said Monday, amid reports the Chinese leader would hold a call with Zelensky.  “We have been encouraging President Xi to reach out to President Zelensky because we believe that PRC and President Xi himself should hear directly the Ukrainian perspective and not just the Russian perspective on this,” National security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One. “We have, in fact, advocated to Beijing that that connection take place.” He said the US had encouraged that conversation “publicly” as well as “privately to the PRC.” Sullivan added that American officials have “spoken with our Ukrainian counterparts today,” and that Ukrainians had not officially gotten confirmation there would be a phone call or a video conference with Xi.  “We hope there will be. That would be a good thing because it would potentially bring more balance and perspective to the way that the PRC is approaching this, and we hope it would continue to dissuade them from choosing to provide legal assistance to Russia,” Sullivan added. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is planning to open two war crimes cases related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and issue arrest warrants against “several people,” according to the New York Times (NYT) and Reuters, citing current and former officials with knowledge of the decision who were not authorized to speak publicly.    According to the NYT, the cases would represent the first international charges to be brought since the start of Russia’s war and come after months of work by special ICC investigation teams.    The first case the ICC is set to open is about Russia’s alleged abduction of Ukrainian children. The second is on Russia’s “unrelentingly” targeting civilian infrastructure, including water supplies and gas tanks, according to the NYT.    ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan’s first step is to present his charges to a panel of pretrial judges, who will decide whether legal standards have been met for issuing arrest warrants or whether investigators need more evidence, the NYT reported.        In a response to a request from CNN on the NYT’s reporting, the ICC’s Office of the Prosecutor said that they “provide no comment on this report.”       The ICC chief visited Ukraine last month to probe Russia's attacks on power and other infrastructure. Khan told reporters during the visit that “we see clearly a pattern, I think, in terms of the number, scale and breadth of attacks against the power grids of Ukraine. And we need to look at why that's taking place; are they legitimate targets or not; and whether or not they are targeted for other reasons." “There seems to be a lot of damage in Ukraine, and it may well be it is part of a policy and part of a plan and we need to get to the bottom of it and see whether or not there is criminal responsibility and if there is we have an International Criminal Court that has jurisdiction to look into it,” he added.    When asked whether the court’s process may be too slow to meet the expectations of the Ukrainians, the top prosecutor said: "What people want are not Pyrrhic victories.”    "As a prosecutor we are officers of the court. We are not here to get a round of applause by a conjuring trick. Whenever we do move, (people) should have confidence that this is not a political process,” he continued.     More background: Earlier this month, CNN reported on 15-year-old Arina Yatsiuk, one of 345 Ukrainian children who disappeared since Russia’s February 2022 invasion, according to official Ukrainian statistics.    The Ukrainian government says many of the missing children have been forcibly taken to Russia. The Russian government doesn’t deny taking Ukrainian children and has made their adoption by Russian families a centerpiece of propaganda.     One senior Ukrainian official told CNN on Monday that they have been pushing the ICC for some time to seek arrest warrants against Russian individuals in relation to the war in Ukraine.     “Ukraine has been pushing for Russian officials involved in war crimes to be prosecuted by the ICC, up to and including (Russian President Vladimir) Putin who is ultimately responsible,” the official said.    The fighting around Bakhmut is relentless with Ukrainian troops clearing Russian trenches in close-quarters combat, according to the Ukrainian military.  Wagner assault units are sustaining "significant losses" as the Russian mercenary group advances from several directions around the besieged eastern city, a top Ukrainian military commander said. Wagner’s chief said his troops are nearing the city center but the Ukrainians are "fighting for every meter." Here are more of the latest headlines: Russia and UN agree to an extension of grain deal: Russia and the United Nations have agreed to a 60-day extension of the Ukraine grain deal after negotiations in Geneva, Russian state news agency RIA reported on Monday. Why are grain exports so important? Ukraine and Russia are both significant suppliers of food to the world. Before the war, Ukraine – known as one of the globe’s breadbaskets – would export around three-quarters of the grain it produced. According to data from the European Commission, about 90% of these exports were shipped from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. The war and its impact on grain exports, therefore, has major implications, particularly in the global South which relies heavily on them. International Criminal Court to open war crimes cases over invasion, reports say: The International Criminal Court is planning to open two war crimes cases tied to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and issue arrest warrants against “several people,” according to the New York Times and Reuters, citing current and former officials with knowledge of the decision who were not authorized to speak publicly. The cases would represent the first international charges to be brought since the start of Russia’s war and come after months of work by special ICC investigation teams, the Times said. War "far too fluid" to include additional funding in 2024 budget, Pentagon says: The Pentagon’s $842 billion 2024 budget request does not include additional funding for Ukraine in its war against Russia due to the unpredictability of the conflict’s longevity, officials said.  A senior defense official told reporters on Friday that the Pentagon’s fiscal year 2024 budget request has $300 million for Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative “that has always been in the budget,” but otherwise doesn't include any other funding. Pentagon budget request does include additional munitions funding: While the Pentagon’s budget request may not include additional funding specifically for Ukraine, it does include an almost $6 billion increase in munitions funding which is “sort of informed and pressurized on the ground side by the Ukraine fight and the things that we’ve been giving to Ukraine,” the official said. White House: US encouraging Chinese president to speak with Zelensky: The US has been encouraging President Xi Jinping to speak directly with President Volodymyr Zelensky, the White House said Monday, amid reports the Chinese leader would hold a call with the Ukrainian leader. “We believe that PRC and President Xi himself should hear directly the Ukrainian perspective and not just the Russian perspective on this,” National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said. EU extends sanctions against Russia: The European Union Council on Monday announced it had extended sanctions placed on Russia for a further six months. The current sanctions apply to 1,473 individuals and 205 entities, and include travel restrictions, the freezing of assets, and a ban on making funds or other economic resources available to the listed individuals and entities, it added.   Ukrainian official says Wagner is stepping up recruitment effort in Russian-occupied city: The mayor of the Moscow-occupied city of Melitopol in southern Ukraine said that Russia's Wagner private military company has unsuccessfully tried to recruit from among the city's population despite stepping up efforts. ##Catch Up## ##Bakhmut## Russia continues to be the “most acute threat” to the UK’s security, Britain’s government said in a review of its security approach published on Monday.  The report, called the “Integrated Review Refresh 2023,” announced an expansion in defense investment by 5 billion pounds (around $6 billion) over the next two years.   “What has changed is that our collective security now is intrinsically linked to the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine,” the review – which is an update on one published in 2021 – said.  In the long term, the UK would aim to increase its “baseline commitment of spending” on defense from 2% of GDP to 2.5%, the review said.   It said that China “poses an epoch-defining challenge to the type of international order we want to see,” and identified China’s “deepening partnership with Russia and Russia’s growing cooperation with Iran” as two developments of “particular concern.”  Regarding Russia, the review said that the UK’s objective would be “to contain and challenge Russia’s ability and intent to disrupt the security of the UK, the Euro-Atlantic and the wider international order.”  On China, the report announced a doubling of funding “to build China capabilities across government to better understand China and allow us to engage confidently where it is in our interests to do so.”  In response to the increase in defense spending, Tobias Ellwood, chair of the UK's Defense Select Committee, told Sky News on Monday that Russia and China “would be breathing a sigh of relief that we have not invested further in our armed forces at this time.”   Speaking to UK parliament about the report, British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said that "on every continent of the world, the United Kingdom walks taller today than it has done for many years.”      Russia and the United Nations have agreed to a 60-day extension of the Ukraine grain deal after negotiations in Geneva, Russian state news agency RIA reported on Monday. "Our Russian interdepartmental delegation has just completed another round of talks with UN representatives led by UNCTAD Secretary General R. Greenspan and OCHA head M. Griffiths,” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin said at a briefing on Monday, according to RIA. The diplomat added Moscow had agreed to extend the current grain deal, which lasts until March 18, for an additional 60 days.  "But just for 60 days,” Vershinin said. “Any further grain policy will depend on actual —based on not what's said but what's done — progress on the normalization of our agricultural exports, including bank payments, transport logistics, insurance, unfreezing of financial activities and the continuation of ammonia supply through the Tolyatti-Odessa pipeline.” Why are grain exports so important? Ukraine and Russia are both significant suppliers of food to the world. Before the war, Ukraine – known as one of the globe’s breadbaskets – would export around three-quarters of the grain it produces. According to data from the European Commission, about 90% of these exports were shipped by sea, from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. The war and its impact on grain exports therefore has major implications, particularly in the global South which relies heavily on them. CNN's Rob Picheta, Jomana Karadsheh, Radina Gigova and Tim Lister contributed to this post. Russia and China have “clearly” aligned themselves on propaganda and disinformation regarding the war in Ukraine, and the United States and the West have not invested enough over the years in countering such disinformation, a senior State Department official said Monday. “The United States as a country, the West as a society, has been slow to accept and realize the extent to which China and Russia have made operations in the information space part and parcel of their national objectives,” the official told reporters. The official said that China and Russia “have spent tens of billions of dollars” on disinformation over the years, and “we, I believe, are just coming to grips as a country and as a society.” “I think it's been talked about, but I don't think that we have yet put the resources and energy behind it that we should. And that doesn't mean that people haven't tried,” the official said, adding that it's only in "recent years that we've all come to see the dark side of the communications revolutions in digital technology.” “Meanwhile, the Russians and the Chinese in particular have been working that dark side,” the official said. The US official noted that the war in Ukraine has helped awaken the West to the issue, saying, “when democracies are aroused, as they have been from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the democracies have shown their power this last year.” “The autocracies are weaker as a result of the last year. So I believe that when aroused that we will succeed, but we have not been sufficiently aroused,” the official said. They described Moscow and Beijing as having “an echo chamber” and “a feedback loop” of spreading the false narratives about the war, and said, “they try to get more and more attention by sharing narratives.” The official suggested these disinformation efforts were de facto state-sponsored, because “in Russia and China, we generally believe that the major media operations are well aligned by their governments.” The official added that the State Department’s Global Engagement Center, which is tasked with countering foreign disinformation, put out a report several years ago that found the Russian government “operates disinformation at the highest levels of government” and the “Chinese propaganda system is operated at the highest levels of government.” The official said that the head of the Global Engagement Center (GEC) at the State Department would be traveling to Eastern Europe “where there are operations that repeat and promulgate Russian disinformation,” and will engage with governments there on how to “shut it down or mitigate it or limit it,” instead of “waiting for these people to repeat it and promulgate it.” The Pentagon’s $842 billion 2024 budget request does not include additional funding for Ukraine in its war against Russia due to the unpredictability of the conflict’s longevity, officials said as they briefed on the details of the request.  A senior defense official told reporters on Friday that the Pentagon’s fiscal year 2024 budget request has $300 million for Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative “that has always been in the budget,” but otherwise there is “not other Ukraine funding in here.” “If that is still an ongoing issue in [2024], we would expect to handle that by contingencies, contingency or supplemental funding, which is the way that every emergent operation has been handled for about 50 consecutive years in this government,” the official said. “So no different here. It is far too fluid for us to be putting anything now projecting into 24 what the situation might be.”  The official emphasized that the absence of additional funding “in no way shape or form means that it is not important to us.”   Some more context: Since Russia’s invasion more than a year ago, the US has given roughly $30 billion in assistance to Ukraine. The White House’s budget, released last week, included $6 billion from the Pentagon and State Department for Ukraine and other European allies.  While the Pentagon’s budget request may not include additional funding specifically for Ukraine, it does include an almost $6 billion increase in munitions funding which is “sort of informed and pressurized on the ground side by the Ukraine fight and the things that we’ve been giving to Ukraine,” according to the official. It also invests almost $5 billion to “adapt capabilities to the evolving threat” in Europe.  But the official specified that in the new budget request, the focus is on weapons “more for the broader strategy for a higher-end fight.”  “They’re not ground munitions,” the official said. “You’ll see Naval strike missile, standard missile, AMRAAM, things like that.” Indeed, the items falling under the multi-year contract requests are the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile Extended Range (JASSM-ER). Asked why the Pentagon wasn’t able to get the same kind of contracts for things like the Patriot missile system and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLR) — which are in high demand in Ukraine — the official said it’s “harder than it looks” to get a multi-year contract. The munitions request within the massive budget include $5.6 billion for ammunition, $17.3 billion for tactical missiles, $7.3 billion for strategic missiles, and $0.6 billion for technology development. It also includes over $1 billion for the munitions industrial base in an effort to “modernize and expand capacity.” The budget request, released Monday, prioritizes China as the US’ “preeminent pacing challenge,” and allocates just over $9 billion to Pacific deterrence, investing in “new missile warning” and construction, as well as training and information sharing with other partners in the region. The European Union Council on Monday announced it had extended sanctions placed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine for a further six months.   The sanctions, which will remain in effect until September 15, 2023, target “those responsible for undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,” the council said in a statement.   The current sanctions apply to 1,473 individuals and 205 entities, and include travel restrictions, the freezing of assets, and a ban on making funds or other economic resources available to the listed individuals and entities, it added.   “In the European Council conclusions of 9 February 2023, the EU reiterated its resolute condemnation of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, which constitutes a blatant violation of the UN Charter, and has brought immense suffering and destruction upon Ukraine and its people,” the council said.   “Russia must stop its atrocious war immediately,” it added.   The EU's renewal of sanctions against Russia comes after the bloc approved its 10th package of sanctions in February. The mayor of the Moscow-occupied city of Melitopol in southern Ukraine said that Russia's Wagner private military company has unsuccessfully tried to recruit from among the city's population despite stepping up efforts. Ivan Fedorov, who is not in the city himself, told Ukrainian television that at the end of last week, occupying authorities had begun using social media to try to recruit residents for Wagner.   "Of course, no one agrees," Fedorov said. "The offers they make are allegedly 200,000 rubles (approximately $2,600) per month to those who are ready to go to Bakhmut as part of Wagner. But they have not recruited anyone from the local population to join any volunteer battalion. They will not recruit for this one either." CNN has been unable to verify such a recruitment campaign but the Wagner group has stepped up recruitment efforts after sustaining heavy casualties around the eastern city of Bakhmut. Russian forces are suffering "significant losses" in the continued fight for Bakhmut, and troops are reportedly engaged in close-quarters combat, according to Ukrainian commanders. Elsewhere, Russian officials have said that there are no prospects for peace in Ukraine as things stand, as well as repeating calls for an independent investigation into the explosions which knocked out the Nord Stream gas pipelines. Here are the latest headlines: Struggle for eastern city continues: Fighting continues in Bakhmut around the clock, with Ukrainian troops clearing Russian trenches in close-quarters combat, according to a Ukrainian deputy commander. "The situation in Bakhmut is extremely tense. The enemy is trying to storm AFU positions and doing everything they can to advance," said Maj. Rodion Kudriashov. Wagner losses mounting: Wagner assault units are sustaining "significant losses" as they advance from several directions around Bakhmut, said a top Ukrainian military commander. Russia's Ministry of Defense is likely using the assault on Bakhmut to degrade Wagner forces in order to weaken Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the private military company, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Kremlin plays down prospect of peace: Russia’s goals in Ukraine can only be achieved by military means, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. “So far, there are no prerequisites for the transition of the process to a peaceful course,” he said.  Russia repeats call for Nord Stream investigation: Moscow still does not know who carried out the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines, according to Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev. Recent reports of Ukrainian involvement are questionable, and Russia wants an objective investigation into the explosions, he said. Chechen leader backs Ukraine invasion: Pro-Kremlin Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has reiterated that Chechen fighters in Ukraine will help Moscow “fight to the victorious end.”  Russian air defenses shoot down four missiles: At least one person was injured in Russia's southern Belgorod region after air defenses shot down four missiles Monday, said regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov. Ukraine becomes third largest weapons importer: Ukraine accounts for 2% of global arms imports during the last five years, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). ##Catch Up## Russia’s goals in Ukraine can only be achieved by military means, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists Monday. So far, there are no prerequisites for the transition of the process to a peaceful course,” Peskov said. "For us, the absolute priority continues to be, and will always remain, the achievement of our goals. Now they can only be achieved by military means." The Kremlin has maintained this position for some time. At the end of February, China published a "peace plan" for Ukraine, but Peskov said that there was no prospect of peace. “The special military operation (the Kremlin euphemism for its war on Ukraine) continues, we are moving towards achieving the goals that were set,” he added at the time. Pro-Kremlin Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has reiterated Chechen fighters in Ukraine will help Moscow “fight to the victorious end.” During a visit at the Kremlin Monday, Kadyrov reported to Putin that “we in the Republic (Chechnya) are doing really well, thanks to you.” Kadyrov told the Russian president: “The fighters of the Chechen Republic are successfully serving in the special military operation zone, we are fulfilling all your orders and aim to act to the victorious end. The residents of the region fully support the special military operation and consider it necessary to achieve its goals and objectives.” Kadyrov has been accused by international and independent observers of gross human rights violations in his home territory and beyond. He leads sizeable paramilitary forces that — while formally a part of Russian security structures — have personal loyalty to him. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday there was “an element of politicization” in Navalny, the film that won this year's Oscar for best documentary feature. On a conference call with journalists, Peskov said: “Although I haven’t watched it, I dare to assume that there is a certain element of politicization of the topic here. Hollywood also sometimes does not shun the topic of politicization in its work.” The film explores the plot to kill Russian opposition leader and former presidential candidate, Alexei Navalny, and won the Oscar for best documentary feature at Sunday's Academy Awards. Directed by Daniel Roher and presented by CNN Films and HBO Max, Navalny charts his political rise, attempted assassination and search to uncover the truth. An outspoken critic of the Kremlin, Alexei Nalvany is currently serving a nine-year term at a maximum-security prison east of Moscow. Fighting continues in Bakhmut around the clock, with Ukrainian troops clearing Russian trenches in close-quarters combat, according to a Ukrainian deputy commander. "The situation in Bakhmut is extremely tense. The enemy is trying to storm AFU (Armed Forces of Ukraine) positions and doing everything they can to advance," said Maj. Rodion Kudriashov, deputy commander of Ukraine's 3rd Detached Assault Brigade, on Monday. "The situation is tense, but fully under AFU control. We are resorting to mobile defense and are counter-attacking the problem sections." "During infantry battles, when we are regaining our own positions and storming the enemy's, our units literally jump feet first into enemy trenches and knock the enemy out of its trenches. There are ongoing gun battles at 10-50 meters distance," Kudriashov told Ukrainian network Espreso TV. A pro-Russian military blogger said that Wagner fighters had begun their assault on the underground part of a large metallurgical plant in Bakhmut. "Right now, storm troopers have entered the underground communications of the Artyomovsk Metal Processing Plant (AZOM) and are breaking into the mine," said the blogger Alexander Simonov. CNN could not confirm that claim. ##Bakhmut## Moscow still does not know who carried out the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines, according to Russian Security Council Secretary and former security chief Nikolai Patrushev. Speaking to the Russian newspaper Argumenty i Fakty, Patrushev said recent reports of Ukrainian involvement is questionable, affirming earlier comments from the Kremlin that media reports of a “pro-Ukrainian” group behind the attack were “hard to believe." Patrushev reiterated that Russia wants an objective investigation into the explosions. “Without it, the voicing of unilateral subjective versions of the terrorist attack does not explain anything,” he said. An unnamed boat suspected by the German prosecutors’ office of possibly carrying explosives linked to the explosions last September left the Baltic Sea port of Rostock, Germany on September 6, 2022, according to German public broadcaster ARD, citing its own investigation. The ARD reporting cited unnamed security sources from five countries. ARD says the boat was carrying six people: one captain, two divers and two assistant divers, all of whom were men, as well as one female doctor. Their nationalities are not known. Ukraine has denied any involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, following a report in the New York Times citing intelligence sources who said that a “pro-Ukrainian group” may have been behind last year’s attack targeting Russia’s gas deliveries to Europe. Russia's Ministry of Defense is likely using the assault on the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to degrade Wagner forces in order to weaken Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the private military company, according to Western analysis. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) commented Sunday that the Russian rate of advance there had slowed following the Ukrainian withdrawal from the east of the city around March 7. ISW assessed tha
