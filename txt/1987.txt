Six people, including five children, were killed and one woman was injured in a car crash on Interstate 24 in Tennessee early Sunday morning. Emergency medical services responded to a collision of two vehicles at the interstate's westbound mile marker 23 in Robertson County, according to a news release from Robertson County Emergency Medical Services. "A total of 4 Advanced Life Support ambulances responded to this scene and one helicopter/air ambulance," the release said. "Initial arriving units worked quickly to search for, assess and triage the total 9 patients involved." The driver of one of the vehicles involved in the accident was not injured, according to the release. "Only one other vehicle was involved. The vehicle was a car that was found upside down with very extensive damage," the release read. "Another adult male was ambulatory on the scene and reported to responders that he had been in this car. This man was stable with what appeared to be minor injuries at that time." An adult female "believed to have been ejected from the car" was found in critical condition, according to the release. The woman was flown to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. Her current condition is unclear. Six others, including five children, were pronounced deceased on the scene "with injuries that could not be resuscitated," the release read. All six, whose ages range from 1 to 18 years old, are believed to have been ejected from the vehicle. The Tennessee Highway Patrol told CNN in a statement they are investigating the crash and will release additional information when it becomes available. "Our office recognizes the incredible difficulty of this scene. Further coordination to involve professional mental health and counseling services for responders has been established," Robertson County Emergency Medical Services said in its release. "Please keep the families and persons involved in your thoughts and prayers."
