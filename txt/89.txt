Six people were injured in a shooting after fights broke out on a South Carolina beach Friday while high school seniors were skipping school before spring break was set to start, police said. Hundreds of people were at the beach in the coastal city of Isle of Palms, about 15 miles east of Charleston, when gunfire erupted around 5:20 p.m. ET Friday, Police Chief Kevin Cornett said during a news conference. The chief said the shooting began amid several fights among people who were participating in senior skip day. Cornett said five of those injured were around the age of 18. One adult woman in her mid-30s or early 40s was also wounded, Cornett added. Some of the injured were taken to a hospital while others went on their own. All injuries were non-life-threatening, according to city officials. Five of those injured were released from hospital by Saturday, Isle of Palms City said in a news release. The other remains in stable condition. Two individuals were charged in the incident: a 16-year-old for unlawful carry of a firearm and possession of a stolen firearm, and an 18-year-old for unlawful carry of a firearm, the release said. However, authorities have not confirmed if either was involved in the shooting. Police continue to investigate, the police chief said.
