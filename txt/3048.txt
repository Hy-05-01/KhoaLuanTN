The deaths of three Michigan rappers whose bodies were found in an abandoned apartment building in early February were related to gang violence, state police said, asking members of the public who might have information about the case to come forward. In a series of tweets Friday, Michigan State Police confirmed they were continuing to investigate the triple homicide of Armani Kelly, 28; Dante Wicker, 31; and Montoya Givens, 31, who were reported missing after their January 21 performance at a Detroit club was canceled. Their bodies were found almost two weeks later in the apartment complex in Highland Park, about 6 miles northwest of Detroit, and state police later said they each died of multiple gunshot wounds. "This was a gang violence related incident," Michigan State Police said on Twitter on Friday, addressing what it said were "rumors" circulating about the investigation. "This homicide was not random and had nothing to due (sic) with music or a performance." While no one is in custody, police said, "There are other people that know the details and we need them to come forward." "Together we can bring closure to these families," state police said. Police were first alerted to the men's disappearances by Kelly's mother, who reported him missing on January 23, Michael McGinnis, commander of major crimes at the Detroit Police Department, previously said. As the story of Kelly's disappearance gained media attention, "other family members of the other missings come to realize that that's a friend of their loved ones and they haven't seen them either, so then they both get reported missing," McGinnis said. The bodies were discovered February 2, in the complex police described as "rat infested." Several days later, state police confirmed "this was not a random incident" and said investigators believed they had determined a motive.
