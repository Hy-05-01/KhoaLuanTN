Journalist Elliott Gotkine reports from Tel Aviv, Israel, where thousands of protesters have flooded the streets on the day Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, who had opened up a rift in the government by calling for a pause to controversial plans to overhaul the country's court system. This protest is a continuation of demonstrations going on for months across the country.
