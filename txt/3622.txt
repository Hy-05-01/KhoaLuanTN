Kelly Clarkson says she's done with marriage, but open to finding love again and committed to supporting her children as they adjust to her divorce. The singer recently talked about her split from Brandon Blackstock, the father of her two children, and the impact it has had on her family. "I literally ask my kids every night when we're snuggling, 'Are you happy? And if you're not, what could make you happier?'" Clarkson said on "The Angie Martinez IRL Podcast." "Sometimes they'll say, especially the past two years, and it kills me and I want them to be honest, so I don't ever say, 'Oh god, don't tell me that,' but a lot of times it would be like, 'You know, I'm just really sad. I wish mommy and daddy were in the same house.'" She added, "I'm raising that kind of individual. I want you to be honest with me." Clarkson said being raised in a divorced family herself helped her to better understand the feelings involved. "I just sit there and I'm like, 'I get it. I'm from a divorced family as well. I get it. That sucks,'" she said. "But we're going to work it out. And you are so loved by both of us. I think communicating with them and not treating them, not treating them like an adult, because they're not â€” but not treating them like a child. They're not small feelings. Those are huge feelings, and those are huge emotions." Clarkson and Blackstock broke up in June 2020, with the singer citing irreconcilable differences. She said while she doesn't plan to marry again, she does want to find love. "I won't be getting married," she said. "In my life, I've been through a couple of divorces in my own family as a kid. I would love to fall in love. I would love to find someone and fall in love and do that thing, but I have children and that's why I say that."
