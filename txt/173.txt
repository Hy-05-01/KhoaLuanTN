One of the doctor's treating Jeremy Renner following his snowplow incident says the actor has come a long way incredibly quickly. Dr. Christopher Vincent, a chiropractic sports physician, spoke to CNN's Alisyn Camerota Friday night from Winter Park, Colorado, about the rehab process for Renner, an Oscar-nominated star of Marvel's "Avengers" movies and "The Hurt Locker." Vincent says the machine came within millimeters of hitting a vital organ or major nerve. "As unlucky as he is to have such a tragic injury, he is so lucky that the injuries are where they are," Vincent said. Renner was crushed by a snowplow on New Year's Day and broke several bones including eight ribs, an eye socket, a knee and shoulder. "He's pushing through it and really has the determination to not only heal but come back stronger and better than he was before," Vincent said. Renner will likely have some form of rehab for the rest of his life, but Vincent said he has a drive to overcome the pain and the injuries.
